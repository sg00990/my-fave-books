    <p>Unwind is a 2007 dystopian novel by young adult literature author Neal Shusterman. 
        It takes place in the United States in the near future. After the Second Civil War was fought over abortion, 
        a compromise was reached, allowing parents to sign an order for their children between the ages of 13 and 18 to be "unwound" â€” 
        taken to "harvest camps" and dissected into their body parts for later use. 
        The reasoning is that, since 99.44% of the body is used, unwinds do not technically die because their individual body parts live on.</p>
