        <p>Joanne Rowling, CH, OBE, HonFRSE, FRCPE, FRSL (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/ ROH-ling;[1] born 31 July 1965), 
            known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author, philanthropist, film producer, and screenwriter. 
            She is the author of the Harry Potter series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500 million copies as of 2018,[2] 
            and in 2008 became the best-selling book children's series in history.[3] The books are the basis of a popular film series. 
            She also writes crime fiction under the pen name Robert Galbraith.</p>
            <p>Time named her a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, 
                and political inspiration she has given her fans.[9] In October 2010, 
                she was named the "Most Influential Woman in Britain" by leading magazine editors.[10] 
                Rowling has voiced views on UK politics, especially in opposition to Scottish independence and Brexit, 
                and has been critical of her relationship with the press. Since late 2019, she has publicly expressed her opinions on transgender people and 
                related civil rights. These have been criticised as transphobic by LGBT rights organisations and some feminists, 
                but have received support from other feminists and individuals.</p>
