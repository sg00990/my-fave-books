            <p>Richard Russell Riordan Jr. (/ˈraɪərdən/; born June 5, 1964)[1] is an American author. 
                He is known for writing the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, about a teenager named Percy Jackson who 
                discovers he is a son of the Greek god Poseidon. Riordan's books have been translated into forty-two languages and 
                sold more than thirty million copies in the US.[2] 20th Century Fox adapted the first two books of his Percy Jackson series 
                as part of a series of films. His books have spawned related media, such as graphic novels and short story collections.
            </p>
                <p>Riordan's first full-length novel was Big Red Tequila, which became the first book in the Tres Navarre series. 
                    His big breakthrough was The Lightning Thief (2005), the first novel in the five-volume Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, 
                    which placed a group of modern-day adolescents in a Greco-Roman mythological setting. Since then, Riordan has written The Heroes of Olympus, 
                    a sequel to the Percy Jackson series; The Kane Chronicles (2010-2012), a trilogy of similar premise focusing on Egyptian mythology; 
                    and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard (2015-2017), again a triology of similar premise focusing on Norse mythology.[3][4] 
                    Riordan also helped Scholastic Press develop The 39 Clues series and its spinoffs, and penned its first book, The Maze of Bones (2008).[5] 
                    His most recent book is the Daughter of the Deep, published in 2021.</p>
